PART 3:

During lab of week 2 one of the things that I learn was about curl and how it is a versatile command when it comes to downloading and uploading files. During lab of week 3 something that I learned was how to log into a remote server without the need of a password which saves me time for future use. These are some of the things I learned during labs that I didn't know before
